       "'Data scientists use a variety of software and programming languages. They often use R and Python for creating specific tools for each project. For handling the complexity of big data and its computational intensity, Hadoop is commonly used as it distributes computational tasks on multiple computers. For business intelligence visualizations, software like Power BI, SaS, Qlik, and Tableau are used. EViews is used for working with econometric time-series models, and Stata is used for academic statistical and econometric research. In addition to R and Python, data scientists working with big data may also use languages like Java or Scala. \\n\\n- Resource: Programming Languages & Software Employed in Data Science - All the Tools You Need'"
