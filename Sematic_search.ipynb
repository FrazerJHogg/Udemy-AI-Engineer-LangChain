Clustering is an amazing technique often employed in data science. But what’s more, it makes much more sense to study patterns observed in a particular group rather than trying to find patterns in the entire dataset. We will provide several practical examples that will help you understand how to carry out cluster analysis and the difference between classification and clustering.\n",

We will look at some edge cases that can arise during the classification process and discover how to handle them.
