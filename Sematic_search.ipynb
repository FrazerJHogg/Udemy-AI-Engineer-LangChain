We will then use this dataset to train and test a KNN classification algorithm with the help of Python’s scikit-learn library. We will look at some edge cases that can arise during the classification process and discover how to handle them. Next, we will guide you through the process of building the so-called decision regions, which are a great way of visualizing the performance of your model. Finally, we will find out how to choose the best model parameters using a technique called ‘grid search’. \n",
